# Cellma
> Cell based texteditor.

## Philosophy
> Cellma is not your usual <b>texteditor</b>, Cellma is your
> <b>friendly dictator</b>.
> Cellma will not allow more than <b>80 characters horizontally</b>.
> Even though she might be <b>rough</b>, she is also very <b>playful</b>,
> <b>hackable</b> and
> <b>customizable</b>.
> Cellma is a <b>colorful</b> <b>dictator</b>.
> She is a <b>texteditor</b>.

## Usage
> <b>Left-ALT + W</b> to scroll up.<br>
> <b>Left-ALT + S</b> to scroll down.

### Please note
> Please note that this texteditor is currently just a proof of concept and
> is not of any use at this state.

> There is a lot of problems and issues that I haven't taken care of yet,
> I have just been playing around with what it can do.

> For example, there is some array-index-out-of-bounds problems when moving
> the cursor in the editor. It's a pretty easy fix but I just haven't taken
> care of it yet.

> You may also note that I am coming from a Python, Java, PHP, Javascript world
> and I might have broken every C/C++ rule there is, in this project.
